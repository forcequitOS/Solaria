# Solaria
tvOS 26 jailbreak tweak to enable Liquid Glass on unsupported Apple TV models.

Tested on, verified working:
- tvOS 26.2 (23K54) on Apple TV 4K (1st generation)
- tvOS 26.1 (23J582) on Apple TV 4K (1st generation)

Solaria has a few settings you can toggle on and off:

- Liquid Glass (Enables/disables the tweak)
- Enable in Unsupported Apps (Enables Liquid Glass in apps not yet compiled with the tvOS 26 SDK, needs the Liquid Glass toggle on first)
- Enable in Opted-Out Apps (Enables Liquid Glass in apps that manually opted-out of having Liquid Glass support, needs the Liquid Glass toggle on first)

Changes will apply upon relaunching a process, so please **respring to apply changes fully.**

Additionally, please respring after installing, although again it will take effect as new processes start. PurePKG is exceptionally bugged and doesn't restart PineBoard after installing.

Do be warned, ***this will be laggy.*** Apple doesn't support Liquid Glass on these models for a pretty good reason. There also could be some visual glitches, bugs, etc. as a result of using this, so be cautious. Nothing should completely break though, and turning off Liquid Glass from Settings allows you to back out and try it again later.

Fun fact: This is the first jailbreak tweak I'm ever writing. Was pretty neat. Used AI for a solid 80% of it. 6/10 would do it again.
