tvOS 26 jailbreak tweak to enable Liquid Glass on unsupported Apple TV models.

I don't feel like documenting this. The code is somewhat messy. It's extremely sketchy.

Fun fact: This is the first jailbreak tweak I'm ever writing. Was pretty neat. Used AI for a solid 80% of it. 6/10 would do it again.
